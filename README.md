- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the app.
- **JavaScript**: Fetching weather data and dynamically updating the page.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a city name into the search box.
2. The application makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using a free API key to fetch the weather data for that city.
3. The weather information such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed is displayed on the page.

## API Information
